# Mindscapes

## Keoni Lanoza

### MINDSCAPES OVERVIEW

A "mindscape" is a piece of my mind. It is a setting that I frequently imagine in my mind, for who knows what reason. The Mindscapes project seeks to take these imaginary locations and recreate them in Unity, and who knows? Maybe one day someone who's imagined the exact same thing as me will come along!

### MINDSCAPES

### ARBOR DALE

Arbor Dale is a honey-tinted place of falling leaves, roaming bears, and a weirdly linear forest. It's odd because of the frequently occuring rows of trees that suggest this to be a man-made grove, but if that's the case, where are the people? 

### ARBOR DALE NOSTALGIA BUILD

The Arbor Dale Nostalgia Build follows what's most true to my mind's dreamscape. There exists another default build because I believe it is what's most visually appealing, but the Nostalgia Build abandons visual appeal for the project's integrity.
